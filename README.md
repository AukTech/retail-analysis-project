# Retail Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of a retail dataset containing over 50,000 transactions. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by identifying high-value customers and predicting future sales trends.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified seasonal spikes and the top-performing product categories (Technology vs. Office Supplies).
* **Customer Segmentation (RFM):** Developed a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model to categorize customers into segments like "Champions," "Loyal," and "At-Risk."
* **Sales Forecasting:** Implemented a Linear Regression model to visualize and predict monthly sales growth.
* **Data Integrity:** Performed rigorous data cleaning, including handling missing values, duplicates, and date-time formatting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

## 📂 Project Structure
* `analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and logic.
* `SampleSuperstore.csv`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 📈 Key Insights
* **The VIP Segment:** 12% of the customer base consists of "Champions" who drive a disproportionate amount of total revenue.
* **Growth Trend:** The forecasting model indicates a steady upward trend in sales, with significant peaks during the Q4 holiday season.
* **Product Focus:** Technology items have the highest profit margins, despite lower sales frequency compared to Office Supplies.
